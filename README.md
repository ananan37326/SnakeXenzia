# Snake Xenzia
This is a classic Snake game built with Python's turtle module. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food pellets and growing longer with each one. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or with its own body.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have **Python 3** installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ananan37326/SnakeXenzia.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd SnakeXenzia
```

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script.
```python

```
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement.
3. Try to eat as many food pellets as possible without running into the walls or the snake's body.
4. When the game ends, you can click anywhere to end the program.
5. You can also run the exe file.
